            <h2>Choose your trip</h2>
            <p>We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of comfort and quality, and a solid value
                to our guests.
                These inns offer a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional cuisine, and authentic
                charm. They are
                typically small, independently-owned properties which reflect the character and hospitality of the
                surrounding alpine
                community. We know the owners personally, have a longstanding
                relationship with them, and we find they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an exceptional
                experience.
